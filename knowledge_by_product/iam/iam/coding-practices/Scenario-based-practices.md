# IAM Scenario

You opened a new AWS account. The account consists of five teams of 10 developers. Your first tasks are the following:

- You need to create 50 users:
  - 40 of them are developers.
  - 5 are managers.
  - 5 are administrators.
  - The 40 developers will have the same permissions.
  - The 5 managers will have the same permissions.
  - The 5 administrators will have the same permissions.

- If possible, the developers should have access to Amazon EC2 without security credentials tied to their IAM user.

- Amazon EC2 instances will need access to Amazon S3.

- You need a way to audit so that credential lifecycle requirements are compliant.

- You need a way to manage IAM user permissions.

- You need to apply strong security measures to protect the AWS account.

### Steps to Address the Scenario

1. **IAM Setup**:
   - Set up IAM service for identity and access management.

2. **IAM Users**:
   - Create 50 IAM users:
     - 40 for developers.
     - 5 for managers.
     - 5 for administrators.

3. **IAM Groups**:
   - Create groups for each user type:
     - `Developers`
     - `Managers`
     - `Administrators`
   - Assign permissions based on roles for each group.

4. **IAM Policies**:
   - Attach policies to groups:
     - Define permissions for developers, managers, and administrators.

5. **Roles**:
   - Create IAM roles for developers to access EC2 without requiring permanent security credentials.

6. **AWS Access Analyzer**:
   - Use AWS Access Analyzer to monitor and identify unintended resource access.

7. **IAM Credential Report**:
   - Generate IAM Credential Reports regularly to audit user credentials and ensure compliance with lifecycle requirements.

8. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users.
   - Use strong password policies.
   - Regularly rotate credentials for IAM users.
